====== DESCRIPTION ======

This tutorial explains how to import a new project into Git, make changes to it, and share changes with other developers.
If you are instead primarily interested in using Git to fetch a project, for example, to test the latest version, you may prefer to start with the first two chapters of The Git Userâ€™s Manual.

First, note that you can get documentation for a command such as git log --graph with:

{{{code: lang="html" linenumbers="True"
$ man git-log
}}}


or:

{{{code: lang="html" linenumbers="True"
$  git help log
}}}


With the latter, you can use the manual viewer of your choice; see git-help[1] for more information.

It is a good idea to introduce yourself to Git with your name and public email address before doing any operation. The easiest way to do so is:

$ git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"
$ git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com
